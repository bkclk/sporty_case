# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Design & Implementation Notes

### Design

I did not use any external design tool or library because this is a small project and the page does not include many parts.

For styling, I chose **SASS** (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) as a CSS preprocessor. SASS allows for more maintainable and modular styles through features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which help keep the codebase organized and scalable even as the project grows.

### Search

For the search functionality, I used the `fuse.js` package to match similar names. This provides a much better user experience than exact matches.

Additionally, I added a sorting feature that allows users to sort the results by name and game type, making it easier to organize and find the desired entries.

### State Management

I did not use any global state management solution (like Context or Redux) because it was not necessary for this project. However, for larger projects, such solutions can be considered.

### Development Tools

For the whole project, I used the Cursor built-in AI tool to assist with coding and implementation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
